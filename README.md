##  Overview

![vinylly_slide2](/assets/images/readMe/slide2.png)


* v i n y l l y enables a user (age 18+, for now) to access a library of music organized by genre

* While listening to music, the user can read band biographies and browse events showcasing the band or artist currently playing

* Life-like animations and graphics allow the user to tap into the nostalgic pleasures of vinyl (without having to deal with the perils of those fancy record player thingamajigs)

* The record player is full-screen to make for an excellent backdrop to a party playlist

## How It Works

* Age verification is used to confirm a user is age 18+. If they are under age, they are politely denied access to the site

* If they pass age validation, a user is then prompted for their name (which is optional) and a musical genre

* Currently, the library is limited to a few genres (as we have no incorporated the Spotify API yet). Available genres include:
    *  rock
    *  psychedelic
    *  rap
    *  hip-hop
    *  soul
    *  jazz
    *  country
    *  pop
    *  alternative

* CSS classes are dynamically manipulated to animate the record player and the album art (jQuery and CSS Hover libraries are used). 

*  Bands-in-Town and Last.FM APIs allow the user to view upcomming events and read more about the artist playing.

*  The site is styled with CSS and Bootstrap. We used a reset.css file to fully customize our look!


##  On The Horizon

![vinylly_slide4](/assets/images/readMe/slide4.png)

This is the first generation of vinylly. There are plans to drastically improve the user experience by including a larger library (spotify API) and changing the log-in feature so that the user can directly log into their spotify account.
