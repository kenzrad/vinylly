###v i n y l l y  is an interactive digtal record player that visually enhances the musical listening experience with the vintage vibes of vinyl.

##Overview

To listen music in vinylly, the user must verify their age (you must be 18+ to enter). Once validated, the user can enter their name (optional) and a genre of music. Currently, the library is limited to a few genres (as we have no incorporated the Spotify API yet). Current genres include: rock, psychedelic, rap, hip-hop, soul, jazz, country, and pop.</p>

CSS classes are dynamically manipulated to animate the record player and the album art (jQuery and CSS Hover libraries are used). Bands-in-Town and Last.FM APIs allow the user to view upcomming events and read more about the artist playing</p>

##On The Horizon

This is the first generation of vinylly. There are plans to drastically improve the user experience by including a larger library (spotify API) and changing the log-in feature so that the user can directly log into their spotify account. Eventually, vinylly will allow the user to select from a variety of record player skins to customize their experience.</p>
